#01.DataStructure

	1. Tree: BinarySearchTree
		1.1 IsBstUtil: Check if a binary tree is BST or not
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/
		1.2 InsertNode: Create Binary Tree

		1.3 InOrderTraversal, PreOrderTraversal, PostOrderTraversal : Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder and Postorder)
			https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/
		1.4 PrintGivenLevel : Print all the node at the give level

		1.5 MaxDepth: Find the max depth of the tree

	2. Trie: Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). 
			 If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in 
			 tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However the penalty is on Trie storage requirements

	3. BinaryHeap: Heap Data Structure is generally taught with Heapsort. Heapsort algorithm has limited uses because Quicksort is better in practice.

		2.6 DuplicateInArray: Find duplicates in O(n) time and O(1) extra space. Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any 
							  of these numbers appearing any number of times. Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.
